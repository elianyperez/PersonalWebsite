# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: I'm honored to announce that I have been awarded a 2024 Pilot Grant by the Scientific Research Network on Decision Neuroscience and Aging at The University of Texas at Dallas. This prestigious recognition supports our project aimed at understanding the changes in risk tolerance and decision-making in relation to cognitive aging and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease. Our multidisciplinary approach combines computational modeling, virtual reality, and cognitive psychology to explore these vital aspects. This grant not only acknowledges our team's dedication but also propels our efforts in advancing research critical for improving the lives of older adults and those with cognitive impairments.
