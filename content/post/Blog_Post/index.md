# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: I am excited to share that I had the privilege of presenting my research on risk tolerance across gambling and navigation domains in Santa Barbara, CA. The opportunity to showcase my work and connect with esteemed experts in the fields of decision making and aging was invaluable. I am grateful for being granted a full scholarship for this training opportunity, which allowed me to expand my knowledge and forge meaningful connections. This experience has further fueled my passion for studying decision-making processes and their impact on aging.
