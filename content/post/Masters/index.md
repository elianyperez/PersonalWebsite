subtitle:

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: I'm excited to announce that I have successfully defended my Master's thesis titled "The Role of Risk Tolerance in Navigation Strategy Decisions." This research, which will be published as a Registered Report soon, delves into the intriguing connection between risk tolerance in the context of the explore/exploit tradeoff and navigation strategy. I am grateful for the guidance and support I received throughout this journey. This milestone marks an important step in my academic career, and I am excited to contribute to the scientific community with my findings. Stay tuned for the upcoming publication!
