I am a first-generation graduate student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Florida, with a strong background in cognitive neuroscience. My passion lies in leveraging data-driven approaches to understand and address cognitive challenges associated with aging. I aim to create impactful tools and interventions that can help improve decision-making and navigation in older adults. My research under the guidance of Dr. Steven Weisberg has involved exploring how individual differences in spatial navigation relate to decision-making processes across the adult lifespan. I have honed skills in computational modeling, fMRI analysis, and behavioral research.

As a member of the Latinx/e community, I am also committed to promoting diversity in research and creating inclusive solutions that benefit a wide range of users. I am passionate about applying my skills to projects that make a meaningful difference, especially those that enhance user experiences and address real-world challenges.

UPDATE: Graduating in Spring 2025 and open to work opportunities!
