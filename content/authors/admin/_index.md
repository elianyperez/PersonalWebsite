I am a first generation graduate student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Florida. As a cognitive neuroscientist, I am interested in examining cognitive declines associated with healthy and pathological aging. My main goal is to develop tools and interventions that can  help ease age-related cognitive deficits and improve navigation decisions among older adults. Under the mentorship of Dr. Steven Weisberg, I am conducting research on the intersection between individual differences in spatial navigation behavior and neural mechanisms of decision-making across the adult lifespan. I am using computational modeling, fMRI, and behavioral methods in an effort to achieve this goal.

As a member of the latinx/e community I am also passionate about conducting research on diverse populations as well as providing guidance and training for undergraduate students from minority and underrepresented backgrounds.
