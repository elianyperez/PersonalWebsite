abstract: "Variability in human spatial navigation is the rule rather than the exception. Some people become lost easily and frequently, whereas others create remarkably accurate maps of their environments. Here, we provide an overview of the ways in which human navigators vary and a framework for how this variability can be explained. Overall, people show individual differences in navigation outcomes—can they achieve their navigation goals—as well as navigation processes—how they navigate. We also describe several levels of explanation for why people show individual variability on a task as essential as navigation."
