abstract: "The aging of our population has been accompanied by increasing
  concerns about older adults' vulnerability to violations of trust and a
  growing interest in normative age‐related changes to decision making involving
  social partners. This intersection has spurred research on age‐related
  neurocognitive and affective changes underlying social decision making. Based
  on our review and synthesis of this literature, we propose a specification
  that targets social decision making in aging to the recently proposed
  Affect‐Integration‐Motivation (AIM) framework. Our framework specification,
  Changes in Integration for Social Decisions in Aging (CISDA), emphasizes three
  key components of value integration with particular relevance for social
  decisions in aging: theory of mind, emotion regulation, and memory for past
  experience. CISDA builds on converging research from economic decision making,
  cognitive neuroscience, and lifespan development to outline how age‐related
  changes to neurocognition and behavior impact social decision making. We
  conclude with recommendations for future research based on CISDA's
  predictions, including implications for the development of interventions to
  enhance social decision outcomes in older adults."
